Hi, my name is Jeff Parrish and **Symbolic Logic** is a small software development
shop in Sacramento, California.

I enjoy attacking hard problems with simplicity and compromise. Experienced with
engineering user experiences, REST and socket based APIs (TCP, RPC, Web Sockets),
email/SMTP, WebRTC, and learning more about voice-over-IP every day.

The toolset du jour is Node.js, React.js, and Golang.

Successful projects mean sticking to goals and deadlines, letting go of distractions,
and adjusting to customer feedback. Writing code is the easy and fun part.

Some projects:

[Psych Scribbles - Practice Management for Mental Health](https://www.psychscribbles.com)

[Mailsac - Disposable Email](https://mailsac.com)
