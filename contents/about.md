**Symbolic Logic** is a small business development company in Sacramento, California
run by Jeff Parrish.

Lean, minimum viable solutions are a way of life. The route to a solid MVP
means sticking to goals and deadlines, letting go of distractions,
and adjusting to customer feedback.

One or two developers with the right skills and mindset can outproduce
a large team. This is the foundation of Symbolic Logic.
