**Symbolic Logic** is a small business development company in Sacramento, California
run by Jeff Parrish.

The focus is on building and investing in simple, purposeful software that
solves specific business problems.

Lean, minimum viable solutions are a way of life. The route to a solid MVP
means sticking to goals and deadlines, and adjusting to customer feedback.

Success in software requires a minimalist and disciplined approach, build
around productive and enjoyable development tools.

Experience shows that **one or two business-oriented developers with the
right mindset can outproduce a team 5x its size**. This is the foundation
of Symbolic Logic.
